# landing-page

First complete project after working through the foundation portion of the Odin Project. Webpage is a black canvas with no specific topic; landing page was to get familiar with how to make and adjust the appearance of a fundamental page. 

Recall of html and css was tested, resource lookup was used, and revision of foundation material were used throughout the process. 

Git commands and commits progressively became more familiar. Learning!
